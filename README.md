# Workflow-Manager  
**Version 1.0 – Foundation Release: Script-Driven Automation**

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Workflow-Manager is a developer-friendly tool built to handle repetitive issues that occur in everyday engineering work. Instead of manually fixing the same bugs or running the same scripts repeatedly, this tool provides a consistent interface to upload, edit, and simulate Python scripts.

The goal is simple: reduce repetitive effort now, and evolve into a fully automated or AI-assisted workflow engine later.

---

## 🧩 Features (v1.0)
- Upload a `.py` file and instantly load its contents into the editor.
- Edit the code directly in the UI.
- Run simulations using the integrated backend logic.
- Reset button to clear editor state quickly.
- Clean and simple UI designed for productivity.
- Solid base for future automation and AI enhancements.

---

## 🎯 Why this matters  
Developers often deal with recurring low-value tasks like log cleanup, data fixes, and script tweaks. This tool speeds that up by providing a consistent environment where scripts can be tested and reused.

As the project grows, it can be expanded with automation modules, pattern detection, script templates, and AI-generated suggestions.
